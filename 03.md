Here are the SQL queries based on the provided schema:

---

### **Schema**:

- **Books Table**: `BookID (PK), Title, AuthorID (FK referencing Authors), Genre, Price`
- **Authors Table**: `AuthorID (PK), FirstName, LastName, Nationality`
- **Customers Table**: `CustomerID (PK), FirstName, LastName, Email, Phone`
- **Orders Table**: `OrderID (PK), CustomerID (FK referencing Customers), Date, TotalAmount`
- **OrderDetails Table**: `OrderDetailID (PK), OrderID (FK referencing Orders), BookID (FK referencing Books), Quantity, Subtotal`

---

### **Queries**:

1. **Retrieve the titles of all books along with their corresponding authors' first and last names:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Books.Title AS BookTitle, Authors.FirstName, Authors.LastName 
    FROM Books 
    INNER JOIN Authors ON Books.AuthorID = Authors.AuthorID;
    ```
    
2. **Find the total amount spent by each customer in the year 2021:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Customers.FirstName, Customers.LastName, SUM(Orders.TotalAmount) AS TotalSpent 
    FROM Customers 
    INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID 
    WHERE YEAR(Orders.Date) = 2021 
    GROUP BY Customers.CustomerID, Customers.FirstName, Customers.LastName;
    ```
    
3. **Calculate the total sales generated from book sales in each genre, sorted by revenue:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Books.Genre, SUM(OrderDetails.Subtotal) AS TotalSales 
    FROM Books 
    INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON Books.BookID = OrderDetails.BookID 
    GROUP BY Books.Genre 
    ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
    ```
    
4. **Identify customers who have purchased books from more than one genre:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Customers.FirstName, Customers.LastName, COUNT(DISTINCT Books.Genre) AS GenresPurchased 
    FROM Customers 
    INNER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID 
    INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID 
    INNER JOIN Books ON OrderDetails.BookID = Books.BookID 
    GROUP BY Customers.CustomerID, Customers.FirstName, Customers.LastName 
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT Books.Genre) > 1;
    ```

### **Explanation**:

1. **Query 1**: Joins the `Books` and `Authors` tables to fetch book titles and their authors' names.
2. **Query 2**: Filters orders by the year 2021, calculates the total amount for each customer, and groups by customer.
3. **Query 3**: Aggregates sales by genre and sorts the results by revenue in descending order.
4. **Query 4**: Counts distinct genres purchased by each customer and filters for those who purchased books from more than one genre.
