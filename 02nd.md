Hereâ€™s how you can solve the SQL queries for the provided schemas:

---

### **First Schema Queries:**

#### Schema:

- **Teams**: `TeamID (PK), TeamName, Captain, Coach, ICCRank`
- **Players**: `PlayerID (PK), FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, Role, Age, Batsman, Bowler, AllRounder, Wicketkeeper, TeamID (FK referencing Teams)`
- **Matches**: `MatchID (PK), Date, WinTeam (FK referencing Teams), LoseTeam (FK referencing Teams), Draw`
- **Tournaments**: `TournamentID (PK), TournamentName, StartDate, EndDate, Host`
- **TournamentMatches**: `TournamentID (FK referencing Tournaments), MatchID (FK referencing Matches)`
- **PlayerPerformance**: `PerformanceID (PK), MatchID (FK referencing Matches), PlayerID (FK referencing Players), Runs, Wickets`

#### Queries:

1. **Find the total matches won by a team:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Teams.TeamName, COUNT(Matches.MatchID) AS TotalWins 
    FROM Teams 
    INNER JOIN Matches ON Teams.TeamID = Matches.WinTeam 
    GROUP BY Teams.TeamName;
    ```
    
2. **List all players who participated in matches in a specific tournament:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT Players.FirstName, Players.LastName 
    FROM Players 
    INNER JOIN PlayerPerformance ON Players.PlayerID = PlayerPerformance.PlayerID 
    INNER JOIN Matches ON PlayerPerformance.MatchID = Matches.MatchID 
    INNER JOIN TournamentMatches ON Matches.MatchID = TournamentMatches.MatchID 
    WHERE TournamentMatches.TournamentID = 'YourTournamentID';
    ```
    
3. **Find the highest run-scorer in a tournament:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Players.FirstName, Players.LastName, SUM(PlayerPerformance.Runs) AS TotalRuns 
    FROM Players 
    INNER JOIN PlayerPerformance ON Players.PlayerID = PlayerPerformance.PlayerID 
    INNER JOIN Matches ON PlayerPerformance.MatchID = Matches.MatchID 
    INNER JOIN TournamentMatches ON Matches.MatchID = TournamentMatches.MatchID 
    WHERE TournamentMatches.TournamentID = 'YourTournamentID' 
    GROUP BY Players.PlayerID 
    ORDER BY TotalRuns DESC 
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

### **Second Schema Queries:**

#### Schema:

- **Artists**: `ArtistID (PK), Name, Genre, Country, DebutYear`
- **Albums**: `AlbumID (PK), Title, ReleaseDate, ArtistID (FK referencing Artists), Genre`
- **Songs**: `SongID (PK), Title, Duration, AlbumID (FK referencing Albums), ReleaseDate`
- **BillboardChart**: `ChartID (PK), ChartDate, ChartName`
- **ChartHistory**: `EntryID (PK), ChartID (FK referencing BillboardChart), SongID (FK referencing Songs), Position, WeeksOnChart`

#### Queries:

1. **Retrieve all artist names and their genres:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Name, Genre 
    FROM Artists;
    ```
    
2. **Retrieve the list of songs along with their album titles:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Songs.Title AS SongTitle, Albums.Title AS AlbumTitle 
    FROM Songs 
    INNER JOIN Albums ON Songs.AlbumID = Albums.AlbumID;
    ```
    
3. **Retrieve the list of artists and their albums, including artists who don't have any albums:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT Artists.Name AS ArtistName, Albums.Title AS AlbumTitle 
    FROM Artists 
    LEFT JOIN Albums ON Artists.ArtistID = Albums.ArtistID;
    ```
    
4. **List the names of artists who have charted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart:**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT Artists.Name 
    FROM Artists 
    INNER JOIN Albums ON Artists.ArtistID = Albums.ArtistID 
    INNER JOIN Songs ON Albums.AlbumID = Songs.AlbumID 
    INNER JOIN ChartHistory ON Songs.SongID = ChartHistory.SongID 
    INNER JOIN BillboardChart ON ChartHistory.ChartID = BillboardChart.ChartID 
    WHERE BillboardChart.ChartName = 'Billboard Hot 100';
    ```
